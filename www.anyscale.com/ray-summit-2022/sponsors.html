As more machine learning models are deployed into production, it is imperative we have tools to monitor, troubleshoot, and explain model decisions. Join Aparna Dhinakaran, chief product officer at Arize AI, in a discussion on the state of commonly seen ML production monitoring challenges. Learn how to use ML Observability from training through production environments to find upstream model issues faster, monitor your models in real time at scale, and improve model interpretability and explainability. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis talk will highlight common challenges seen in models deployed in production, including model drift, data quality issues, distribution changes, outliers, and bias. The talk will also cover best practices to address these challenges, and how to use observability and explainability to help identify model issues before they impact your business.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTalk 2: Approaching Cluster Multi-tenancy with Ray Job\u003cbr\u003eMaintaining a highly available service with close to zero downtime and optimal performance is both challenging and almost mandatory in the world of data-intensive operations. Our strategy for achieving scalability and reliability without compromising on simplicity of implementation involves utilizing Ray API functionality in simple but clever ways. We'll explore how to incorporate multi-cluster sanity, seamlessly swappable dependencies, and fail-safe cluster transitions with long-running Ray clusters to meet the demands of modern cloud infrastructure. We will also touch on challenges that we faced at Ikigai when implementing this strategy and how we overcame those to reach stability.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTalk 3: Large-scale distributed approximate nearest neighbor search with Ray\u003cbr\u003eOne of the simplest and most reliable learning methods in AI is to use memory: retrieve training data points that are closest to the testing data. However, as the datasets grow, such search gets prohibitively expensive. This talk will describe how we use Ray to develop approximated large-scale, distributed nearest neighbor search. In particular, I will describe applications to fraud detection in images of the scientific literature. Next, I will describe how we harness Ray to process tens of millions of scientific articles and images and billions of keypoints extracted from these images. Then, I will describe how we use Ray to integrate GPUs into this computation, effectively cutting down billion-scale searches from days to seconds. Finally, I will discuss how we use Ray Serve to provide this search as a service, hiding all the complexity behind a simple interface. I will end by discussing how Ray compares to other tools we have attempted to use in the past, including Message Passing Interface (MPI) and Dask, and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of Ray.","talkType":"Technical Talks","difficulty":"","tags":"","hasVirtual":false,"speakers":[{"speakerId":"1024","firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Acuna","company":"Computer Science Department, University of Colorado","jobTitle":"Associate Professor","speakerBio":"Daniel Acuna is an assistant professor in the School of Information Studies at Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY.

On the other hand, AI projects usually start with a Python notebook running on a single laptop or workstation, and one needs to go through a mountain of pains to scale it to handle larger datasets with high performance (for both large-scale experimentation and production deployment). These often require data scientists to follow many manual, error-prone steps and even make intrusive code changes so as to fully take advantage of the available hardware resources. To address these challenges, we have open sourced BigDL 2.0 (https:/ /github.com/intel-analytics/BigDL/) under the Apache 2.0 license (combining the original BigDL and Analytics Zoo projects), which allows users to build end-to-end AI pipelines that are transparently accelerated on a single node (with up to 9.6x speedup in our experiments) and seamlessly scaled out to a large cluster (across several hundreds of nodes in real-world use cases). It automatically provisions Big Data and AI systems (such as Ray and Apache Spark) for the distributed execution; on top of the underlying systems, it efficiently implements the distributed, in-memory data pipelines (for Spark Dataframes, TensorFlow Dataset, PyTorch, DataLoader, as well as arbitrary Python libraries), and transparently scales out deep learning (such as TensorFlow and PyTorch) training and inference on the distributed dataset (through scikit-learn style APIs). BigDL 2.0 has already been adopted by many real-world users (such as Mastercard, Burger King, Inspur, etc.) in production. In this session, we will demonstrate how to build an end-to-end AI pipeline using BigDL2.0 on Ray, and showcase real-world BigDL use cases.","talkType":"Technical Lightning Talks","difficulty":"Beginner","tags":"Scalable ML/AI","hasVirtual":false,"speakers":[{"speakerId":"1130","firstName":"Jiao","lastName":"Wang","company":"Intel","jobTitle":"AI Framework Engineer","speakerBio":"Jiao (Jennie) Wang is an AI framework engineer on the Machine Learning Platform team at Intel, working in the area of big data analytics.

In addition, few graph processing systems really implement serverless fault tolerance capability, hindering wide adoption in production. Hence, at ByteDance, we proposed an enterprise-level Graph Analytics Platform (GAP) for graph computing and graph mining, named ByteGAP, to process super large graphs such as Douyin and TikTok. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eByteGAP is built on a serverless engine atop KubeRay to provide flexible cluster resource management, automatic deployment in the cloud, elasticity for scalability, and fault tolerance.

Thanks to Ray's powerful abstraction of tasks/actors/GCS, we have built a Ray-based control plane for rank management, agent (actor) rendezvous, and stateful fault tolerance as an infrastructure component. It handles failures at node level, agent level, and worker level end-to-end with synergy that MPI can not fully cover. The Ray agents of dynamically assigned ranks manage worker processes of different languages as well as checkpoints in PMEM.

Alpa automates model-parallel training of large deep learning (DL) models by generating execution plans that unify data, operator, and pipeline parallelism. Existing model-parallel training systems either require users to manually create a parallelization plan or automatically generate one from a limited space of model parallelism configurations, which does not suffice to scale out complex DL models on distributed compute devices. Alpa distributes the training of large DL models by viewing parallelisms as two hierarchical levels: inter-operator and intra-operator parallelisms. Based on this, Alpa constructs a new hierarchical space for massive model-parallel execution plans. Alpa designs a number of compilation passes to automatically derive the optimal parallel execution plan in each independent parallelism level and implements an efficient runtime to orchestrate the two-level parallel execution on distributed compute devices. Our evaluation shows Alpa generates parallelization plans that match or outperform hand-tuned model-parallel training systems even on models they are designed for. Unlike specialized systems, Alpa also generalizes to models with heterogeneous architectures and models without manually designed plans. In this talk, we will focus on both the algorithm side and also the engineering/system implementation side, where Ray is a crucial building block of the Alpa runtime.","talkType":"Technical Talks","difficulty":"","tags":"Serving","hasVirtual":false,"speakers":[{"speakerId":"1124","firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Zhang","company":"UC Berkeley","jobTitle":"Postdoc","speakerBio":"Hao Zhang is a postdoc researcher at UC Berkeley working with Ion Stoica.

In many cases ML engineers prefer to develop data pre-processing as part of their ML training code, making quick iterations and debugging much easier. This puts high pressure on performance and reliability of data pre-processing, because we need to make sure that by the time an ML model is ready to accept a next mini-batch of data, it is already available. Otherwise we will be wasting GPU time. Some of these data transformations could have run offline and cached, but there is no existing system available which would make it easy to move the logic between training and offline batch data processing jobs. Moreover, the memory usage of the data processing pipeline is a large consideration for us due to the use of high resolution sensors our cars have.

This drives a growing demand for graph technologies applied in this domain. The core concept of bill of materials (BOM) linked to product data, linked to supplier networks, production planning, inventory data, linked with customer and sales data almost naturally translates into graphs. Meanwhile much the relevant input for AI in manufacturing is stored in documents, spreadsheets, or legacy data silos. NLP and deep learning applications help prepare such data for integration into graph models.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe graph space has transformed over the past few years: graph neural networks provide exciting new capabilities, graph visualizations augmented by GPU break through previous barriers, algorithms of mathematical graph theory can be applied at scales hardly doable before. There are popular graph query languages and the W3C standards for ontologies and axiomatic inference and validation, and probabilistic graphs. Unfortunately, these camps within graph space remain largely disjoint. An open source project 'kglab' provides integration paths for different kinds of graph work, while aligning with PyData tools. Manufacturing firms including Siemens, Bosch, and BASF began using this library. A follow up project leverages Ray to provide graphs at billion-node scale, for horizontal scale-out of graph compute in large industrial use cases.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis talk explores use cases for AI in Manufacturing, discussing where Ray can address critical bottlenecks at scale, and also helps augment work with NLP and deep learning. We'll consider the roles that Ray could play for more optimal graph technologies. Some points are counter-intuitive: for example, GNNs are quite useful, however the hard problems requiring graph algorithms at scale are often in data preparation (resolving ambiguity, detecting unwanted cycles, handling gaps and errors), which must occur long before training any GNN models. While there are numerous graph database vendors, few can handle scale, and their enterprise licensing costs often exceed the cloud computing costs for large clusters. Ray on K8s can be used to break through crucial limitations, allowing for open source integrations for managing large graphs within secure enterprise environments.","talkType":"","difficulty":"Intermediate","tags":"","hasVirtual":false,"speakers":[{"speakerId":"2052","firstName":"Paco","lastName":"Nathan","company":"Derwen, Inc.","jobTitle":"Managing Partner","speakerBio":"Known as a \"player/coach,\" with core expertise in graph technologies, natural language, data science, cloud computing; ~40 years tech industry experience, ranging from Bell Labs to early-stage start-ups.

It requires models to be fine-tuned and evaluated on a large number of downstream tasks. Such downstream tasks can be very different in problem domain, type of input data, adoption pipeline, and running environment. Therefore, they are usually handled in different pipelines by different research teams. For example, one team might run a GLUE Benchmarking pipeline with 9 sub-tasks while another team might run a Sentiment Analysis pipeline with 17 sub-tasks. Such multi-task evaluation can be both time consuming (it can take a few days or even more) and hard to manage (across different teams and pipelines). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTherefore, a toolkit that can support a unified pipeline for multi-task with easy scaling and independent resource management is highly desirable in this domain.

On the other hand, AI projects usually start with a Python notebook running on a single laptop or workstation, and one needs to go through a mountain of pains to scale it to handle larger datasets with high performance (for both large-scale experimentation and production deployment). These often require data scientists to follow many manual, error-prone steps and even make intrusive code changes so as to fully take advantage of the available hardware resources. To address these challenges, we have open sourced BigDL 2.0 (https:/ /github.com/intel-analytics/BigDL/) under the Apache 2.0 license (combining the original BigDL and Analytics Zoo projects), which allows users to build end-to-end AI pipelines that are transparently accelerated on a single node (with up to 9.6x speedup in our experiments) and seamlessly scaled out to a large cluster (across several hundreds of nodes in real-world use cases). It automatically provisions Big Data and AI systems (such as Ray and Apache Spark) for the distributed execution; on top of the underlying systems, it efficiently implements the distributed, in-memory data pipelines (for Spark Dataframes, TensorFlow Dataset, PyTorch, DataLoader, as well as arbitrary Python libraries), and transparently scales out deep learning (such as TensorFlow and PyTorch) training and inference on the distributed dataset (through scikit-learn style APIs). BigDL 2.0 has already been adopted by many real-world users (such as Mastercard, Burger King, Inspur, etc.) in production.
